YouTubeWhitelist is a free, open-source Android app that gives parents full control over what YouTube content their kids can watch.

Parents browse YouTube and whitelist specific channels, videos, and playlists. Kids only see approved content — nothing else. No algorithm, no recommendations, no surprises.

Features:
* Parent mode with full YouTube browsing and whitelist management
* Kid mode with clean, distraction-free interface showing only approved content
* PIN-protected parent access
* Multiple kid profiles with separate whitelists
* Daily watch time limits per profile
* Sleep mode with timer and gradual volume fade-out
* Watch statistics (daily, weekly, monthly)
* Kiosk mode (screen pinning)
* JSON export/import for backup and restore
* In-app search within whitelisted content
* Full playlist support

Privacy:
* All data stored locally on device
* No ads, no tracking, no analytics
* No backend server

Anti-features:
* NonFreeNet — uses YouTube Data API v3 (Google network service)
